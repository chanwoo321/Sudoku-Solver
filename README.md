# Sudoku-Solver
Hi! This is my first attempt at creating a personal project, so I hope you enjoy it. This code includes a solver.py file that has python code that solves
any Sudoku puzzle by using a backtracking technique. For more information, I would check out https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku_solving_algorithms.

This is still a work in progress, so check back soon!
