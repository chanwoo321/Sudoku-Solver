# Sudoku-Solver
Hi! This is my first attempt at creating a personal project, so I hope you enjoy it. This code includes a solver.py file that has python code that solves
any Sudoku puzzle by using a backtracking technique. For more information, I would check out https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku_solving_algorithms.

At the moment, the algorithm works on the command line or any other compiler that
allows users to input lines.

# How to use the solver
When you run solver.py, you will be prompted to enter each line individually.
Enter in each line by typing the 9 numbers in each row of the sudoku puzzle you
would like to solve in order. If the square is blank, type in a 0. After this is
done, the sudoku solver will print out the board that you typed in to show the board
you have inputted followed by printing out the solution to that board. If no solution
is found, the solver will not print out anything. Note that due to the brute-force
algorithm used, if there are multiple solutions then all possible solutions will be
printed out.

# Possible future updates
In the future, I may update this repository to have a GUI or make the script a bit
cleaner in it's input and how boards are printed. Until then, feel free to enjoy
what is available now and look at my code!
